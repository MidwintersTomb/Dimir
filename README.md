Hostname and MAC changing script for Linux

This will update hostname and spoofed MAC on eth0 when you're connected over WiFi.  This is intended for cases where you're masking your device when connecting to the wired network.  Verify that your NIC is eth0, if  it isn't, edit this script to match yours.  Originally made to function on a Raspberry 
Pi 4 running Kali linux.

I am not doing any input validation.  If you're running this, it's on you to know what you're doing.  Don't bork your stuff, but if you do, it's your choice, and not my fault.
